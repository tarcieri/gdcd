Installation notes for gdcd
---------------------------

gdcd requires either GdkPixbuf or Imlib.  If you don't have either one of these
installed, you will not be able to build gdcd.

Many people have noted problems with gdcd and earlier versions of Imlib.  If
you are experiencing problems with cover art display, please make sure that
your versions of Imlib/GdkPixbuf are at least this new:
(these are the versions that I am using)

Gdk-Imlib: 1.9.8
GdkPixbuf: 0.4

You will also need a POSIX threads library installed.  If one is not installed,
gdcd will not compile.

gdcd requires libcdaudio 0.99.4 or later.  This is available at:
http://cdcd.undergrid.net/libcdaudio/

This program has been tested under Linux only.  I make no claims as to the
performance of this package under other platforms.

Installing gdcd:
----------------

First, type './configure'.  This will run autoconf.  After this run 'make'
then 'make install' to complete the installation.

This installs a group of .PNGs to ${prefix}/share/gdcd (where ${prefix} is
/usr/local by default)  If this poses a problem for you let me know as I
could think of no better place to put them.
